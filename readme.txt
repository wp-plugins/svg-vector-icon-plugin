== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will these plugins loose quality as they scale up? =

No. These icons are not .png or .jpg format. They are .svg (scalable vector graphics), which means you can scale them
as large as you want with out any loss in quality.

= Can you change the color of the icons? =

Yes, by specificying an inline color property to the div. 

= Can you add animations to the icons? =

Yes, but you will need to know how to code CSS3 animations. 

= What is so different between the free and the pro version? =

The pro version was built with ease of use for the end user in mind. The pro version comes with an icon customization window where users
can much more easily change the icon size and icon color. The customization window also features 59 pre-built CSS3 animations
which users can add to any icon in the library. On top of that users can choose when to animate the icon from options such as
'On Load', 'On Hover' and 'On Click'. Within the customization window users can also add a drop shadow, or make the icon appear 3D
with just one click, all while watching the changes in real time within the 'Icon Preview Window'. Users also hve the ability to turn the icon
in to a functioning link to an internal or external page. Once the user is content with the final icon design, they click 'Generate 
Code' where they are given all the necessary code to place that icon anywhere on your site.

It's as easy as copy and paste.

If you buy the pro version you will also receive support for one year, for those times you need to make something out of the ordinary happen.
